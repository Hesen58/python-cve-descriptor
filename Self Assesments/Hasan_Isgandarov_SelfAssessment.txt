Throughout this project, I took on multiple roles, primarily focusing on coding tasks related to data scraping, sharing data references, and managing the exploit aspect of the CVE. Additionally, I did error handling to ensure the reliability and robustness of our application. As the lead developer, I was responsible for project management, coordinating the team's efforts, and guiding the overall development process.

One of the key areas of growth for me was enhancing my Python development skills, particularly in the domain of web scraping. I gained valuable experience using various libraries and techniques to efficiently extract and manipulate data.

Collaboration played a crucial role in our success. I ensured that all the code written by my teammates was integrated smoothly and aligned with our project goals. We relied heavily on GitHub for version control and Teams for communication, which facilitated effective data sharing and problem-solving.

This project was an excellent opportunity to apply my existing knowledge in a practical setting while also expanding my skill set in new areas.
