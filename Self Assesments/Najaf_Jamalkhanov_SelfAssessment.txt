In this project, my primary responsibilities included developing the front-end part of the website. Additionally, I worked on coding the functionality that allows users to download the scraped information as a PDF file.

During the project, I learned several advanced Python skills, particularly related to data scraping and front-end development. These new skills have strengthened my ability to handle both the visual and functional aspects of web applications.

We collaborated effectively as a team by sharing our code through GitHub, ensuring seamless integration of different components. I also frequently brainstormed with my groupmates to find solutions to various challenges, which helped me overcome obstacles and improve our overall product.

This project was a valuable experience that enhanced my technical abilities and emphasized the importance of teamwork and problem-solving.
