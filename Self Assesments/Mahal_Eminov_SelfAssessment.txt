In this project, my main responsibilities were coding parts of the scraping functionality, specifically focusing on the severity and metric aspects of the CVE data. I also contributed to testing the website at the end to ensure its proper functionality.

Throughout the project, I learned new skills in Python, particularly related to web scraping, which has enhanced my understanding and proficiency in handling data extraction tasks. I also gained practical experience in debugging and testing web applications.

Collaboration was a key aspect of our project. We used GitHub for version control and code sharing, where I regularly shared my code with my peers and integrated our changes smoothly. We also held regular meetings via Teams to discuss our progress and coordinate tasks. Additionally, I sought help by asking questions to my developer friends and using AI tools whenever I faced challenges.

Overall, this project helped me strengthen my technical skills and emphasized the importance of effective communication and teamwork.
