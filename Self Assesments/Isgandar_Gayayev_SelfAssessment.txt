During this project, my primary contributions involved coding the part of the scraping functionality that retrieves the description, publish date, status of the CVE entered by the user. I also took responsibility for creating the README.md and author.md files, ensuring our project documentation was clear and comprehensive, and managing the repository to maintain an organized workflow.

This experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of Python, particularly in the context of web scraping. I explored several new Python libraries and learned to leverage their functions effectively for our project's needs.

To ensure smooth collaboration, I shared my code via GitHub and actively participated in our weekly meetings on Teams. I frequently sought guidance from my groupmate Hasan, who has extensive development experience, and also utilized AI tools to solve problems efficiently.

Overall, this project provided me with practical skills in both technical development and team collaboration, reinforcing my ability to contribute effectively to complex tasks.
