# Python CVE Descriptor

A web-based tool that allows users to input a CVE name (e.g., CVE-2021-44228) and retrieves the relevant information through an API. The program then visualizes the information, such as CVE status, CVE ID, CVE severity, and a brief description on the website. If the CVE is not found or the input is incorrect, the user is informed. Additionally, users can download this information as a PDF file.

## Description

This project is designed to help users quickly and easily obtain detailed information about specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). By inputting a CVE identifier, users can access its current status, severity level, ID, and a short description. The project aims to streamline the process of vulnerability management by providing a clear, user-friendly interface and downloadable reports in PDF format.
